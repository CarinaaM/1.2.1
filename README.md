Questions: 
1. How often do you watch movies?
2. What genre of movies do you enjoy most?
3. What is your favorite movie?
4. Would you rather watch movies with others or on your own?
5. Do you prefer action-based movies, or movies with a gradually growing plot?

Rather than having a serious topic to cover with my app, I decided to make a more fun and enjoyable app with questions about a topic that most people love! The data collected through this app could potentially be used for an even larger project, such as one that would develop a movie recommendation based on the results.
